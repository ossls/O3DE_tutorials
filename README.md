[Save Tutorial](https://github.com/ossls/O3DE_tutorials/blob/7d61c7c0e5dd93228bd4625989646968443acc60/Save%20Tutorial/ScriptedSaveSystem_Tutorial.md)

This tutorial explains how you can create a JSON based file save system by combining Lua and Script Canvas. Currently Script Canvas does not have native JSON load/save/parsing functionality. In the meantime, it is possible to leverage Lua for JSON operations.

It covers:

- Creating Script Events
- Using Script Events between Lua and Script Canvas
- Using a Lua JSON parser to save/load JSON files
- Sending the JSON data from Lua to Script Canvas to allow working in a visual environment
